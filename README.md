# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
Here you predict a certain value derived from some input using linear regression and for this, 
you need to understand the statistics behind Linear Regression and basic syntax of python3. Firstly,
let us understand linear regression with a toy example subsequently we'll get an enriched overview of how it works from scratch.
-we divide the complete code into two classes, 
  1. *Linear Regression from Scratch* 
  2. *Linear Regression from sklearn(Machine Learning Library in python).*
